# CS531-Project-Traffic_Governance_System

# Project Overview:
The traffic governance is the project that deals with the traffic on the crossroads. This will work as the cameras on the crossroads will detect it with the help of image processing and getting the count of vehicles will help to detect the heavy lane. After detecting the heavy lane the timer for that particular will increase and the other lane's timer will be balanced accordingly. 

### Key Objectives:
- Optimize traffic flow through the implementation of intelligent signal control, dynamic lane management, and real-time traffic information.
#### Realistic Traffic Signals:
- Our simulation captures the nuances of real-world traffic signals, including their timing patterns and impact on traffic flow.
- This enables a comprehensive analysis of signal optimization strategies, signal coordination, and their effects on overall network performance.
#### Diverse Sensor Simulation:
- The simulation replicates a wide range of sensor types, such as loop detectors and cameras, to provide a rich and realistic data set.
- This allows researchers and engineers to test and evaluate different sensor technologies and their impact on traffic management strategies.
- It also enables the simulation of advanced sensor fusion techniques, which combine data from multiple sensors to enhance accuracy and reliability.
#### Adjustable Control Policies:
- The simulation allows users to create and test various traffic management strategies, such as signal timing optimization, adaptive traffic signal control, and ramp metering.
- This provides a flexible framework to assess the effectiveness of different control policies and identify the most efficient strategies for optimizing traffic flow and minimizing congestion.
- It also enables the evaluation of the impact of traffic demand variations, special events, and incidents on traffic performance.
